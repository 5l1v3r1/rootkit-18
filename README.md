# Linux rootkit
Term paper for the Zurich university of applied sciences seminar in network security.

This project is a very basic implementation of a Linux rootkit.
Main objectives were: 
- Hiding on the disk (can not be found by ls)
- Hiding in the process table (can not be found by ps)

Therefore a system_call hijack was written based on Tyler Borland's great [tutorial](http://turbochaos.blogspot.ch/2013/09/linux-rootkits-101-1-of-3.html).
